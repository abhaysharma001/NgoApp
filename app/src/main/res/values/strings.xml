    <string name="our_story">CHETNA was registered as a public charitable trust in Delhi, India, to start its vital work on child empowerment on 8th March 2002. When literally translated from Hindi, CHETNA means “creating awareness” and stands for “Childhood Enhancement through Training and Action”. We strongly believe in the active participation of children, and thus started working with them from 2002 to address key child rights issues such as survival, protection, development and participation. CHETNA has grown to become a pioneering organisation in raising child protection issues with a team of experienced social workers and professionals. Some members of our team were themselves street connected children, who, with the help of CHETNA have worked their way to a better life and are now resolute towards transforming other similar lives. Since the beginning, the CHETNA team and children have worked together to tailor a range of programs and activities to fit their needs. At CHETNA we live our values, so participation underpins our whole organisation in the form of Badhte Kadam- a unique federation of street connected children. Badhte Kadam run their own fully operational newsletter called Balaknama; the first of its kind in the world. On 12th April 2013, Badhte Kadam made its way into the Limca Book of Records by putting approximately 9,000 hand prints on a white cloth in less than twelve-and-a-half minutes at Bal Bhavan in Delhi, with an aim of increasing visibility of street-connected children under the theme “we too exist”. On 12th April 2016, Balaknama was awarded by the Limca Book of Records as the first Hindi newsletter brought out by street children.</string>
    <string name="our_a_1">The participation of children is fundamental to the achievement of our objectives at CHETNA. Through working directly with the children, together we design the programme of activities that can best meet their needs.</string>
    <string name="our_a_2">We cannot change the situation that Street and Working Children find themselves in without changingthe attitudes of those around them.We work to ensure their immediate stakeholders and society in general better understand their struggle and what can be done to ensure their rights. We work to sensitize a number of individuals and groups aimed at building an environment capable of nurturing and cultivating a child’s potential for growth and development.</string>
    <string name="our_a_3">We use advocacy as a tool to make a positive impact on policy making and bring about the desired refinement in the policies that are being implemented, drafted or discussed. Therefore it is vital in helping us reach our overall vision.</string>
    <string name="who_we_are">Street connected children are among the most marginalized and vulnerable groups in the society. They are exposed to many threats and dangers including child labour, child trafficking, sexual abuse, extreme poverty, physical and mental abuse, and homelessness. A Census of India carried out in 2011 found that the total number of children under the age of 18 involved in child labour is 23.8 million. 10.1 million of these children were aged up to 14. Perhaps the scariest statistics is that children up to 18 years old make up 5 per cent of the country’s total workforce.</string>
    <string name="who_we_are2">According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, all children are born with fundamental rights: Right to Survival – to life, health, nutrition, name, nationality Right to Development – to education, care, leisure, recreation, cultural activities Right to Protection – from exploitation, abuse, neglect Right to Participation – to expression, information, thought, religion Unfortunately millions of children around the world are still being denied access to their basic rights. This situation is a key reason why NGOs like CHETNA continue to be necessary to provide essential services, like Contact Points, in response to the direct needs of street connected children, and to give them opportunities to advocate and improve the implementation of the vital laws that ensure their rights.</string>
    <string name="why_we_exist">Why We Exist</string>
    <string name="why_we_exist1">We are a grass-roots Indian NGO working for the empowerment of street connected children in Delhi and neighboring states. We believe that children are not on the street by choice, but because they are left with no other alternative. Street connected children are just as much a part of this country as any other individual. That is why at CHETNA, we are dedicated to ensuring they receive their rights and are treated equally by our society. We have 17 years of experience working alongside these children attempting to break the vicious cycle of poverty and get them access to their basic human rights of protection, education, healthcare, participation and opportunities for a livelihood. The role and participation of children is central to the work of CHETNA and has shaped us into a truly child-centred organisation. It is our firm belief that children are the protagonists and staff the catalysts for change.</string>
    <string name="our_mission">Our mission is to provide childhood empowerment through training and action, with a special focus on street connected children and especially girls, to ensure their rights.</string>
    <string name="vision">Our vision is to achieve a child-caring society that respects their rights.</string>
